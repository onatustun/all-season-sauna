      Client has not set up his booking service and his sauna is not ready for business and open for public yet so he does not have a booking page setup. It will probably be done after this project deadline is over but the gist of the booking site is when clicked you will be redirected to a external third party acuit scheduling booking page that the client manages. This is the approach the client wants as a competitor uses the same practice.
